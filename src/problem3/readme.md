# The computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block

### Incorrect Filtering Logic:

The filtering logic in `sortedBalances` is incorrect. It uses lhsPriority which is undefined and should use `balancePriority`.
>Fixed the filtering logic to use `balancePriority` instead of `lhsPriority`.

### Unnecessary Filtering:
The filter condition `balance.amount <= 0` is likely incorrect if the intention is to filter out non-positive balances.
>Changed the filter condition to `balance.amount > 0` to filter out non-positive balances.

### Sorting Without Return Value:
The sort function does not return a value for equal priorities, which can lead to unpredictable sorting behavior.
>Modified the sort function to return the difference between `rightPriority` and `leftPriority` for consistent sorting.

### Redundant Mapping:
The `formattedBalances` array is created but not used. Instead, `sortedBalances` is used directly in the rows mapping.
>Removed the `formattedBalances` array as it was not used and directly formatted the amount in the rows mapping.

### Redundant Calls to `getPriority`:
The function `getPriority` is called multiple times for the same `balance.blockchain`, which is inefficient.
>The `getPriority` function is now called once per balance in the map function, and the result is stored in the priority property. And then the filter function is used to filter out balances with a priority of -99 or less and non-positive amounts. This reduces the number of iterations over the balances array.

### Inefficient Sorting:
The sorting function compares priorities and then uses `localeCompare` for equal priorities, which is correct but can be optimized by ensuring the priorities are calculated once.
>The sorting function now directly compares the precomputed `priority` values, ensuring that the priorities are only calculated once per balance. This makes the sorting step more efficient.

### ClassName `classes.row` is not declared:
The `className={classes.row}` line is attempting to apply a CSS class to the `WalletRow` component. However, if using mui v4, I also don't see the useStyles declaration, the classes object is not declared or imported anywhere in the provided code, which will result in an error. To fix this, we can remove the `className` attribute.
>The `className={classes.row}` attribute was removed from the `WalletRow` component because the classes object was not declared or imported, which would cause an error.
